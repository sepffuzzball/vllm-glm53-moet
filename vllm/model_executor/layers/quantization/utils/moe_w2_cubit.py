"""Routed experts on 2-bit tensor-sym planes (cubit moe_w2) for the
DeepSeek-V4 / GLM-5.x MoE family.

Opt-in via VLLM_MOE_W2=1. Replaces the stock routed-expert GEMM path:

  weights : checkpoint mxfp4 e2m1 codes -> {-4,-1,1,4} 2-bit planes built on
            GPU at load (QUANT_PROBE tensor-sym K=4: acceptance 2.73 vs 2.68
            baseline, 12/12 coherent; the sign-sym finding reproduces on
            GLM-5.2 — internal/glm52-sweep). Block-32 UE8M0 scale bytes
            verbatim. FP8 block-quant checkpoints (DS4-FP8, GLM-5.2-FP8) are
            re-quantized at load via build_layer_planes_fp8.
  compute : cubit `moe_w2_mm` SASS GEMM (M<=4 per pair, PRMT-LUT decode,
            QMMA.SF block-32 sfb, f32 act-scale fold per k32) for BOTH
            w13 and w2.
  glue    : moe_align_block_size(block=4) pairs, a32 activation quant
            (fp8 e4m3 + exact f32 PER-32-GROUP scales; the a128 lineage
            quantized per-128 — the 4x-coarser groups plus the group-128
            mid-pipeline requant were the last measured source of the
            +8-11% completion-token inflation vs native; the e8m0-scale
            MXFP8-parity variant lost accuracy: GSM8K 95.5% vs 97.0%),
            silu*up in torch, weighted scatter-add unpermute. All
            steps are tensor ops or driver launches on the current stream:
            CUDA-graph capturable, registered as one custom op.

VRAM: planes+scales ~1.73 GiB/layer (vs ~3.2 GiB raw fp4) -> 43 layers fit
a single 96 GB SM120 board together with the fp8 dense stack and KV.
The MTP drafter keeps the stock DeepGEMM-MXFP4 path: layer names containing
"mtp" are excluded, matching the QUANT_PROBE protocol (drafter unmodified).
